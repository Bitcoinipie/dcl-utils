# Decentraland Map

#### a quick and dirty python parser to draw a static bitmap version of decentraland.

**python coordinate-builder.py**
- juggles the map coordinates into various formats so i could make non-silly api requests.
- it's pretty janky.  use at your own risk.

**python pull-map-data.py**
- will pull down live api data or use cached api data.
- transforms the output into more of a map-based json rather than an auction-based one.

**python map-builder.py**
- uses the map.json generated by pull-map-data.py to actually draw the map.
- it takes a while, btw.  it generates a 7500x7500 image
- individual parcel tiles and the final map get dumped into the /dist directory.
