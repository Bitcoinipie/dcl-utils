# Unofficial Decentraland FAQ

### Hey!  I just heard about this project.  What is Decentraland?

The team has put together a web page talking all about it:  https://decentraland.org/#what-is-decentraland

Basically, it's the first stages of [Snowcrash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash).  Or even [Oasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One) from _Ready Player One_.

### Nice!  So, it's a game?

Not really.

It's a virtual world.  Inside of it, who own land can build games for you to play on their property.  Think about how you can have Disneyland right next to a pet store but also next to a paintball arena.

### That sounds awesome!  When can I play?

It's still in the very early stages.

They have had a few prototype versions that have been playable, but as the project has progressed, they've been making changes.  So far, it's been very early prototypes.  However, they're putting together a team of industry veterans to take their proof-of-concept and shape it into a shipping product.

But, yeah, it'll take some time.

Meanwhile, you should follow the progress on their blog:  https://blog.decentraland.org/

### Oh.  Wait, you said people can own land?  How do I buy LAND?

You can't right now.

The first land auction ended Wednesday, January 3, 2018.  There is an effort to put together another auction to sell the rest of the unsold land, but there hasn't been anything announced yet.

In the meantime, you can get ready for the sale by buying some MANA and loading it into Metamask.

###  Where do I buy Mana?

Here is a list of a bunch of Decentraland Markets where you can buy MANA:  https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/decentraland


### What is Metamask?

That's a great question.  They don't explain it very well, but it's a browser extension that lets you easily send and receive ERC20 Tokens (Ethereum-based Tokens like MANA) to websites.

Essentially, web developers enable your Ethereum address to make easy payments.

You can get it here:  https://metamask.io/

### Once I have my MANA, where is the unsold land?

You can see it on this map:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3mnoch/dcl-utils/master/map/dist/decentraland_map.png

The unsold areas look like dirt lots.

###  Sounds good.  In the meantime, where can I talk about the MANA price and how it's going to MOON!!?!?

That sounds like you need to rub elbows with all the people in the #mana-market channel:  https://chat.decentraland.org/channel/mana-market
